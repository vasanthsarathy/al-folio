I am a Senior Researcher at [SIFT](https://www.sift.net/), an AI
and cyber-security research firm. I received my PhD in computer
science and cognitive science at Tufts University, advised by
Matthias Scheutz and Daniel Dennett. 


My research is in Artificial
Intelligence, focusing on how machines can solve problems
unanticipated by its human designer. I am actively exploring topics
at the intersection of symbolic reasoning/planning and in
reinforcement learning. 

We, humans are creative problem solvers. I
believe our problem-solving skills are enabled by our ability
to conceptualize ideas symbolically in our mind, represent them in
different ways and at different levels of abstraction. So, to solve
unexpected problems, we are able to quickly shift our mental
representations to suit the problem at hand. 

We notice, wonder, raise questions, explore our world, and adapt
our thinking. How can we enable machines to do the same?
